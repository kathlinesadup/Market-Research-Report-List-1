<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluid Chillers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fluid chillers market is primarily segmented into two types: water-cooled chillers and air-cooled chillers. Water-cooled chillers use water as a heat exchange medium and are typically more efficient, making them suitable for larger installations. They require a cooling tower for heat dissipation. In contrast, air-cooled chillers rely on ambient air to reject heat, offering easier installation and lower upfront costs, ideal for smaller applications. Each type has distinct advantages based on efficiency, space, and operational costs.</p></p>
